// CS 0401 Fall 2014
// This handout demonstrates extending the JPanel class to store and
// and manipulate its own graphical components.  Compare this to Counters.java.
// Note that the execution appears identical to that of Counters.java, but the
// code has some interesting differences.  

// See Chapter 12 of the Gaddis text for another example of extending JPanel
// See more comments in the code below.
// We will discuss inheritance in detail soon.
